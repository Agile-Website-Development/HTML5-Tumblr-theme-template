HTML5 Tumblr Theme Template
===========================

HTML5 Tumblr Theme Template (H5TTT) is a basic Tumblr theme based on the HTML5 Boilerplate project. The theme gives you the markup for all post types, along with a selection of recommended scripts and styles to make your theme ready to work cross-browser. **Please use this theme as the basis for your own styling. No visual CSS is included.**

Testing Tumblr theme development
--------------------------------

I&rsquo;ve found the following development flow to be the most efficient when coding Tumblr themes.

1. **Make your desired changes to index.html** (most themes won&rsquo;t require many changes, if any). 
2. **Copy and paste the markup from index.html into a password-protected testing tumblelog that you&rsquo;ve pre-populated with sample content.** Be sure to include all post types in your sample content. *If you&rsquo;ve never pasted a custom theme on Tumblr, click "Customize appearance" when the blog is selected in your Dashboard on tumblr.com, then "Edit HTML". Select all, paste your index.html code. Click "Appearance" to go back. Click "Save".*
3. **Enter the URL for your offsite CSS and Javascript files in the File Host field.** Click "Save".
4. **Work on your style.css and script.js once you&rsquo;re done with index.html.** View your style changes on the testing tumblelog without messing with the markup and excessive copy/paste. Host plugins.js, modernizr-2.0.6.min.js, scripts.js, and style.css on your own server at the path specified in step 3.
