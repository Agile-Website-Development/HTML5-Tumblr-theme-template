HTML5 Tumblr Theme Template
===========================

HTML5 Tumblr Theme Template (H5TTT) is a base Tumblr theme based on the HTML5 Boilerplate project. The theme gives you the markup for all post types, along with a selection of recommended scripts and styles to make your theme ready to work cross-browser.

Testing Tumblr theme development
--------------------------------

I strongly recommend the following development flow.

1. Make your desired changes to index.html (most themes won&rsquo;t require many, if any). 
2. Copy and paste the markup from index.html into a password-protected testing Tumblr theme that you&rsquo;ve pre-populated with sample content. Be sure to include all post types in your sample content. If you&rsquo;ve never pasted a custom theme on Tumblr, click "Customize appearance" when the blog is selected in your Dashboard on tumblr.com, then Theme menu, then "Use custom HTML". Copy all of the code in index.html and paste it into the big text field. Click Save.
3. Work on your style.css and script.js once you&rsquo;re done with index.html. View your style changes on the testing tumblelog without messing with the markup and excessive copy/paste.
